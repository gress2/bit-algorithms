An exploratory implementation of bit overloads of the C++ standard algorithms

## Description
While [The Bit Library](https://github.com/vreverdy/bit) is currently being proposed and reviewed by the ISO C++ Standards Committee, this repository is intended for exploratory developments on bit manipulation algorithm overloads based on the bit library. Once finalized, the algorithms will be merged to the main bit library repository and proposed for standardization to C++.

## Structure
The structure of the repository is the following:
* **`bit-algorithms`**: main project directory
    * **`bin`**: all compiled executable files, including tests and benchmarks
    * **`build`**: temporary files generated by the compilation process, including tests and benchmarks
    * **`config`**: configuration files
    * **`data`**: data files, inputs and outputs
      * **`input`**: input files
      * **`output`**: output files
    * **`doc`**: all documents on the projects including papers, standardization documents, documentation and tutorials
        * **`papers`**: 
            * **`pdf`**: pdf files of technical and scientific papers
            * **`src`**: source files of technical and scientific papers
               * **`figures`**: figures to be included in documents
               * **`packages`**: additional latex packages
        * **`wg21`**: standardization documents for the ISO WG21 standards committee
            * **`html`**: html files of standardization documents
            * **`pdf`**: pdf files of standardization documents
            * **`src`**: source files of standardization documents
               * **`figures`**: figures to be included in documents
               * **`packages`**: additional latex packages
    * **`ext`**:
        * **`bit`**: a local copy of the bit library
        * **`cplusplus`**: a local copy of the required files from the C++ standard
    * **`include`**: main directory, containing the implementation of all the bit algorithms as header files
    * **`lib`**: library files, if any
    * **`src`**: source files including examples, tests, and benchmarks
        * **`benchmarks`**: benchmarking utilities
        * **`examples`**: examples of use of bit algorithms
        * **`manager`**: project manager to automatically generate algorithms files
        * **`tests`**: unit tests for the algorithms
    * `LICENSE`: information on the licensing terms of the project
    * `make.sh`: main makefile to compile different components of the project
    * `README.md`: this file, with the main basic documentation
    
## Style
Every source file follows a strict layout. If you are a contributor please make sure you follow this common style.
* C++ files
    * Indentation: 4 spaces
    * Line width: 80 characters
    * Separators: every file is divided in parts, these parts being delimited by separators
        * Separator styles:
            * 1: `// ========================================================================== //`
            * 2: `/* ************************************************************************** */`
            * 3: `// -------------------------------------------------------------------------- //`
        * Separator styles description:
            * 1: general purpose
            * 2: declarations and types, classes, structures
            * 3: implementation
        * Each section begins with a separator and a title
        * The title is in capital letters, centered, with a white space before and after, without underscores
        * Each section ends with a separator
        * Sections are separated by 3 lines
    * Class members: class members are grouped together
        * Each group corresponds to a category of members (eg: `Types`, `Lifecycle`, `Access`, `Operators`...)
        * In the class definition, each group starts with a comment with the name of the group
        * Each group specifies the class access modifier (eg: public, protected, private)
        * Groups related to implementation details are marked by `Implementation details`
        * The separator titles should specify the path of the group they correspond to:
            * `CLASS NAME: GROUP NAME`, `
            * `CLASS NAME: IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS: GROUP NAME`
    * Every file starts with the following information:
        * `// =============================== FILE NAME ================================ //`
        * `// Project:         The Experimental Bit Algorithms Library`
        * `// Name:            file_name.hpp`
        * `// Description:     1 line description of the file`
        * `// Creator:         Vincent Reverdy`
        * `// Contributor(s):  Vincent Reverdy [2019]`
        * `//                  ContributorFirstName ContributorLastName [FirstYear-LastYear]`
        * `// License:         BSD 3-Clause License`
        * `// ========================================================================== //`
        * `#ifndef _FILE_NAME_HPP_INCLUDED`
        * `#define _FILE_NAME_HPP_INCLUDED`
        * `// ========================================================================== //`
        * The alignment of the second column is 20
    * Every file is followed by a preamble, typically for file inclusion:
        * `// ================================ PREAMBLE ================================ //`
        * `// C++ standard library`
        * `#include <something>` (if any)
        * `// Project sources`
        * `#include "something.hpp` (if any)
        * `// Third-party libraries`
        * `#include "ext/something.hpp` (if any)
        * `// Miscellaneous`
        * `#define something` (if any)
        * `namespace something {` (if any)
        * `// ========================================================================== //`
    * Every file ends with:
        * `// ========================================================================== //`
        * `} // namespace something` (if any)
        * `#endif // _FILE_NAME_HPP_INCLUDED`
        * `// ========================================================================== //`
